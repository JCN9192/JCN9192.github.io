# New project

Decided to start a new Unity project. I'm still on very rough planning stage but here are some "certain" things:
- Local multiplayer.
Players will only be able to play together if they are connected to the same WiFi network. Co-op is what I'm thinking as of now
- Dungeon themed
I'm not entirely positive but I'm leaning towards a dungeon game.
- RPG
This is something that I'm also not entirely positive about.
- Mobile + PC compatible.
Given the fact that I have Google Play Developer account where I can post my games on play store, why shouldn't I release this game on google play? I also want to make a PC compatible game since I haven't done one. I want to know how itch.io works as well. I heard that there is a devlog system but I don't think I'm going to post any devlogs until I publish the game.

About the story, I might add basic story where player don't have to squeeze their head to understand. So real simple one.
Again, I'm not 100% positive about anything that I mentioned. I'm still on very early rough planning stage. Still developing/creating my ideas.
I'm not sure when this project will end but I'll try to complete quite soon and release public beta on both Google Play and itch.io.
I'll keep you guys updated and make another post if my decision has made.
